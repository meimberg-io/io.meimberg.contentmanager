## Build Check Policy

**DO NOT run `npm run build` after every change!**

The dev server (`npm run dev`) provides hot reload and shows errors immediately. Running `npm run build`:
- Stops the dev server
- Forces the user to restart it manually
- Wastes time

**Only run `npm run build` when:**
- Explicitly preparing for deployment
- User specifically requests a build check
- Major refactoring where you need to verify the full build

**For normal changes:** Trust hot reload. Skip the build check.
